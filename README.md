# DataScienceUsingPublicWebAPI
collect a dataset from a public web API and then use Python to prepare, analyse, and derive insights from the collected data


STEPS:
------------------

* Retrieval of sufficient data for analysis from your selected web API.
* Saving dataset in an appropriate format
* Loading dataset in an appropriate representation
* Data pre-processing, including cleaning, filtering, and transformation of the data before analysis
* Data characterisation, summarisation, and analysis of the data
* Analysis should include use of tables and visualisations where appropriate
* Interpretation and explanation of the results
* Conclusions with summary of insights, challenges, and future work
* Code quality and structure, including use of Jupyter notebooks and Markdown comments
